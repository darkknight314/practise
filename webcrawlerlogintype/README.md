This was the first assignment given to backend first year students in the Coding Club.  
It involves python.  
A webcrawler should be made that goes to the site nikskhandelwal98.pythonanywhere.com  
It then prints out the hints of the questions displayed there.  

Key Points:  
1.The code must authenticate the user .. only then can the webcrawler access the site.  
2.The number of questions for which the hint should be displayed must be taken by user input in the python console.
